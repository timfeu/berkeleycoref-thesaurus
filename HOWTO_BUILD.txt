Building instructions
**********************

To build the project, you require Scala Build Tool (SBT), available from http://www.scala-sbt.org/ and
provided by the repositories of many linux distributions. The appropriate Scala compiler
for the target version will be automatically downloaded by SBT.

You have two options to build the source code.

=============
Standalone
=============
For training and evaluation it is recommended to use the standalone version. The
class edu.berkeley.nlp.coref.Driver is the entrypoint for the resulting jar.

The standalone version can be obtained by running

sbt pack

in the base directory. You find the results in target/pack. You can run the system from the
script files in the target/pack/bin directory. JVM options (like "-Xmx20g" to reserve the necessary memory
for training the system) should be providable by exporting the JVM_OPT variable before calling
the script. In case this doesn't work, modify the script files directly (last lines running
exec in "berkeleycoref" for Unix systems and line 92 in "berkeleycoref.bat" for Windows).

=============
Install
=============
The libraries from the standalone version can be added to your classpath to create UIMA applications
as well. However, for cleaner project management we recommend using a build and dependency management
tool like SBT or Maven. You can easily install the compiled jar to your local repository.

For ivy2 (used by SBT), run:

sbt publishLocal

For Maven, run:

sbt publish-m2

You can then reference the project using group "org.jobimtext", artifact "berkeleycoref" and
the version specified in the build.sbt (at the time of writing: 1.0, but should be modified
to "1.0-SNAPSHOT" for development).
